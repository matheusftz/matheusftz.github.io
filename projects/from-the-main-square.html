        <p>"From The Main Square is a compact portrait of social disruption.</p>
        <p>Encircling a central square, a new town emerges in all its diversity. A crossroad of stories, buildings, hopes, and conflicts. Social ties and cultures take root. People nurture sympathy and care for their equals, but also animosity towards those who are different. It doesn't take long for an "us versus them" atmosphere to take over. "From The Main Square" is an interactive VR experience that invites the viewer to witness the rise and fall of a divided society. A civilization blossoms, with all its contradictions, only to become a danger to itself."</p>
        <p>I worked as a <strong>Level Designer/Tech Artist</strong> in this position, being directed by Pedro Harres, I mostly got the 2D animations from the artists and put them in the game world, animating their movement and actions making sure it was in sync with the spritesheets and the VR view.</p>
        <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Unity</p>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2019</p>
